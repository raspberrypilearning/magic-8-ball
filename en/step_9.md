## What next?

- The text is scrolling using the default colour white. Could you add some code to change the colours? See the [getting started with sense hat resource here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/) to help.
- Can you create a pixel art image of a Magic 8 Ball to appear on the LED Matrix as part of the program? See [drawing shapes and patterns](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astro-pi-guide/blob/master/inputs-outputs/led-matrix.md) in this resource.
- Could you add sound effects to your program to make it more interesting?
