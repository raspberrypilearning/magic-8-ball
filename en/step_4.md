## Using IDLE 3 on Raspberry Pi 

A great way to write your code and test it in intervals is to use IDLE 3, a development application for Python. You will be writing your code in Python 3.

- Click on `Menu` > `Programming` > `Python 3 (IDLE)`

- Once the Python shell window has loaded, click on **File** and **New File**. This will open a text editor window in which you can write, save and test your code.

- Save the blank file as `magic8ball.py` by clicking on **File** and **Save As**.
