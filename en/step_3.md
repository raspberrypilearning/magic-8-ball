## Make a Digital Magic 8 Ball

In this activity you will build your own Magic 8 Ball using your Raspberry Pi, a Sense HAT, and some Python code. A Magic 8 Ball is a toy which you ask a closed question to, then shake, and it will give you a prediction.

In preparation for this resource, attach your Sense HAT to your Raspberry Pi by following [this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-guide/assemble.md). 

If you do not have a Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT then you can use [the Sense HAT emulator here](https://trinket.io/sense-hat) or use the embedded sense HAT emulator windows beneath each step in this activity.
