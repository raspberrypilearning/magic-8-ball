## Using the Sense HAT emulator

If you do not have a Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT then you can write your code and test it in intervals using the Sense HAT emulator. 

- Visit [trinket.io/sensehat](https://trinket.io/sense-hat) to access the emulator.
- Delete all the text in the code window so that you have a blank file to work with.
- Follow the instructions in this activity and type your code into the emulator. 
- To save your work, you will need to create an account on Trinket.
