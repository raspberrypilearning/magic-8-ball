In this activity you will build your own Magic 8 Ball using your Raspberry Pi, a Sense HAT, and some Python code. A Magic 8 Ball is a toy which you ask a closed question to, then shake, and it will give you a prediction. 

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Sense HAT

### Software

- Sense HAT for Python 3
