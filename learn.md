By coding a Magic 8 Ball with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to display text to a screen and an LED Matrix
- How to create lists and conditionals in Python
- How to pick items from a list randomly, using the `random.choice` function
- How to use and program an accelerometer to detect movement
